# TakeMeTour's Job Quest 2018 Edition

Thank you for your interest in working at TakeMeTour. First, we would like to take a simple test on your coding skill.

Please fork this repo and work on the test. After finishing the test, please send your repo to WantToWork@takemetour.com (Subject: JavaScript Engineer Application).

The quest has 2 major parts: **Front-end** and **Back-end**. If you interesting on which part you can work on the test only that part. But you can do both. (Or in case you want to apply as **Full-stack Engineer** you should done both. Obviously.)

Also in both part has some question needed to be answer. So don't forget to done that. Answer can be both in Thai or English.

## Front-End

You are going to make a web application which allow users to get some joke from **Chuck Norris**.

> Chuck Norris once ordered a Big Mac at Burger King, and got one.

In case you don't know who the heck is Chuck Norris. See his statement.

(Sorry. Please just google it)

### Features
- Users can get a joke from [Chuck Norris API](http://www.icndb.com/api/)
- Users has options to change number of result jokes, user's first name and last name
- How to display the result is up to you.

### Technical description
- Using data from [REST API](http://www.icndb.com/api/)
- Any tools & framework is allowed.
- If you are using tools & framework which is same as our tech stack (React, Redux, styled-components etc.) will be a plus.
- Any extra feature will be a plus.

### Front-end Questions

1. Please explain a situation that using Redux to manage application state is more helpful than original React's state.
- When you need to track changes to state, log how the state is changing

2. Why do we need "Server-Side Rendering". Please explain.
- It allows the side to load faster, which can create good user experience, and overall SEO. SSR is used to fetch data and pre-populate a page with custom content, leveraging the server’s reliable internet connection.

3. Explain the differences of `null` and `undefined`
- Null means an empty or non-existent value. Null is assigned, and explicitly means nothing.
- Undefined means a variable has been declared, but the value of that variable has not yet been defined.

4. Tell us the benefit of using ESLint.
- Used in white-box testing to find problematic patterns or code that doesn’t adhere to certain style guidelines. 

## Back-End

You are going to made a simple **Thai's joke API**. And this API is follow to REST API pattern.

Thai's joke API can allow user to explore, add, delete, like or dislike Thai's joke.

### Endpoints
- `GET /` Get all jokes.
- `POST /` Add new joke.
- `GET /:id` Get joke by id.
- `DELETE /:id` Delete joke. (In case you hate it)
- `POST /:id/like` Like a joke. (Because we don't have authentication system yet. Like spaming is fine here.)
- `POST /:id/dislike` Dislike a joke. (Same as above. Dislike spaming is fine here.)

### Technical description
- All data must store to the database. Any database is fine. But we prefer MongoDB.
- Back-end code must written in Node.js. Any library or helper tools is up to you.

### Bonus
- If you can make like/dislike system can't be spammed (like or dislike action only happen once for each joke respect to user). We will give you a bonus on that.
- If you deploy this API publicly to anywhere with some **GOOD Thai's joke** to get. We will give you a bonus on that as well. (Deploy to where and how is up to you. But don't forget to send us your work.)

### Back-end Questions

1. Explain a benefit gain from using JavaScript to implements back-end API server.

2. Explain what is a GraphQL?

3. If you have a task to convert existing back-end API which follow to REST API pattern to GraphQL. Which approach you will make?
